# EvenCuriouser

## Description of the Site

"EvenCuriouser" is a full stack application to help teachers and students have a better teaching and learning experience.

School in 2020 has been hard for everyone, and jumping from one application to another was a common complaint from teachers, students and parents. 

This application was designed to try and bring all of the links, assignments, grades, and messaging systems into one centralized location.  Making school - whether it's face to face, virtual, or hybrid - seamless and easy for everyone.
